# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I began to arrange my time more reasonably, breaking down big tasks into small steps and setting small goals every week to complete them on time.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to improve is the continuity of my learning. Some weeks I can complete tasks well, but when the course pressure is high I tend to fall behind.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I often communicate with my classmates and help each other understand the knowledge points.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I will pay more attention to the process rather than focusing on the result.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

No.
