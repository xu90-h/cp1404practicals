## About me

My name is [Huang Xu] and I am a student learning Python for the subject CP1404 at JCU.

## What I've Learned About Clean Code

- Use meaningful and descriptive variable and function names
- Avoid repeating code by using functions and loops
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task
